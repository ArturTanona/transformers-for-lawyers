As the premises were no longer being used by external visitors, the cafeteria’s use ratio had necessarily changed in that it was now used exclusively by the residents of the retirement home, with the result that there was 100% tax-exempt use of the cafeteria.</p>

The fact that the Tax Office refused a partial write-down of the cafeteria shows that there was still an intention to use it from 2009 to 2012. Access to the cafeteria was blocked solely for reasons of safety. There has been no increase in use of the cafeteria by the residents of the retirement home.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">In that regard, it should be noted, first, that it follows from the case-law cited in paragraph 20 above that, in principle, the right of deduction can be exercised only in so far as there is a close and direct relationship between the right to deduct input VAT and the use of the goods or services concerned for taxed output transactions. Therefore, as regards capital goods such as the cafeteria at issue in the main proceedings, if it is established during the adjustment period fixed pursuant to Article 187(1) of the VAT Directive that that relationship, although it existed at an earlier stage, has now disappeared, there is, in principle, a change for the purpose of Article 185 of the directive, making an adjustment of the deduction mandatory.</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Second, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the right of deduction is retained in principle even if subsequently, by reason of circumstances beyond his control, the taxable person does not make use of the goods and services which gave rise to a deduction in the context of taxed transactions (judgment of 28 February 2018, Imofloresmira — Investimentos Imobiliários, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A134&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑672/16</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A134" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2018:134</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A134" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">40</a> and the case-law cited). In that regard, the Court has stated that, in such circumstances, to take the view that it is sufficient, in order to establish the existence of a change for the purposes of Article 185 of the VAT Directive, for a property to remain empty after the termination of the lease to which it was subject, due to circumstances beyond the owner’s control, even where it has been established that the owner still intends to use it for a taxed activity and undertakes the necessary steps to that end, would be tantamount to restricting the right of deduction through the provisions applicable to adjustments (judgment of 28 February 2018, Imofloresmira — Investimentos Imobiliários, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A134&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑672/16</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A134" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2018:134</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2018%3A134" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">47</a>).</p>

<p class="coj-normal">It would be otherwise only if, as the German Government and the European Commission rightly submit, the applicant in the main proceedings had, during that period, found other uses for the cafeteria’s premises entailing transactions which gave rise to the right to deduct VAT.

In such circumstances, the close and direct relationship between the right to deduct input VAT paid on the expenditure incurred and taxed activities subsequently carried out by the taxable person, even though it existed at an earlier stage, would now have been broken.</p>

The need to do so is not called into question by the sole fact that it results from circumstances beyond a taxable person’s control (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 April 2004, Gemeente Leusden and Holin Groep, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2004%3A263&amp;locale=en" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xml;notice=branch">C‑487/01 and C‑7/02</a>, <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2004%3A263" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/pdf">EU:C:2004:263</a>, paragraph <a class="coj-CourtLink" href="./../../../legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2004%3A263" hreflang="en" onclick="target='CourtTab';" type="application/xhtml+xml">55</a>).</p>

<p class="coj-normal">Lastly, it should be stated that the principle of fiscal neutrality does not preclude such a conclusion. The situation of an undertaking which makes investments for the purpose of an economic activity giving rise to both taxed and exempt transactions and which continues to carry out exempt transactions is different from that of an undertaking which makes investments for the purpose of an economic activity giving rise to only taxed transactions without that activity ultimately resulting in such transactions.</p>
